      Process_Description: In 2001, RIDEM Division of Fish & Wildlife staff visited sites to assess overall conditions and suitability of each site for a particular use. A site sketch was made, driving directions from the nearest main road were written and digital photographs were taken. From the field collected information, locations were heads-up digitized in ArcView 3.2 using 1997 1:5000 black and white ortho-photography as a reference. Digitized locations and information were checked by senior staff for accuracy and completeness.
